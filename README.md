## :memo: The Process
The prompt for this project was to come up with a restaurant delivery service for a specific, customisable food item that is relevant to the locality where it is based. 

### :bulb: Project Idea
I decided to go with a restaurant that sells **Shawarma wraps**, which is a middle eastern delicacy. I thought this was a good choice for two reasons-
1. It is a customisable food, with different options for base, fillings, sauces, sides etc.
2. It is popular in Hyderabad, the city where the restaurant is to be based.

I chose the **main target audience** to be *college students and/or young parents*, because this very accurately reflects the people who enjoy the night culture of the city. I wanted the **price range** to be moderate, providing good quality food at reasonable prices. I put together an **elevator pitch** too.


### :thought_balloon: Strategy

#### Target Audience :busts_in_silhouette: 
To define the target audience of my website, I first defined some *user roles.* I then noted down some *pyschographics and demographics* that described my target audience accurately. Demographics consisted of age, gender, class, occupation, etc , and pyschographics included personalities, attitudes, values & lifestyles.

#### User Personas :boy::girl: 
I found that making up *fictional users* that suit my user roles and giving them a name and a backstory helps immensely while designing the website later on. Hence I made up 3 user personas that adhered to some of the demographics and pyschographics mentioned above. 

#### User & client Needs  :notebook:
The next step was to define *User and Client needs*. The user being the target audience and the client being me. This helped me define the information I wanted on the website. 


### :black_nib: Outline of Scope
**Content and Functionality Requirements** : From the strategy I defined in the previous phase, I went on to sketch out the content and functionality needs that my website would have to satisfy. This included the pages and content that the website would need to have and the functionality it would be able to show.


### :round_pushpin: Mappin' it out
Now that the idea was taking shape, it was time to map it out in the form of a ***Sitemap***. It gave a structure to my website and it started to become more rigid and shapely. It was made in *Adobe Illustrator.*


### :black_square_button: Wireframes
Next, I made wireframes for the entire website, in both mobile and desktop forms. This part was done using the software *Balsamiq*.  


### :heart_eyes: All things Visual!

#### Mood Board :art: 
Now that the dreary part was over, it was time for the most fun part (in my opinion :wink:) I browsed through pinterest and put together some images, colors, and typefaces that I felt would accurately portray my website. 

#### Visual Mockups :sparkles:
Using the moodboard, and my wireframes, I mocked up all pages of my website keeping the design consistent throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed the process. I mocked up the pages for both mobile and desktop versions of the websites, and created a simple clickable prototype for both. 


## :end: Conclusion
This project was the most work I've put into a design project so far and it was so satisfying to see the final product after all the hard work. I love the colors and style of the website and am very happy with the outcome.
